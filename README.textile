h1. Blacklight Access Controls

Provides access controls for Blacklight-based applications.

*Background*:  Much of this code was extracted from "hydra-access-controls":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/tree/master/hydra-access-controls


h2. Adding Access Controls to a Blacklight App

h3. Install the gem

* Add blacklight-access_controls to your Gemfile
* bundle install

h3. Configure solr

* Make sure your solrconfig.xml has a requestHandler for "permissions".  For an example, see solr_conf/conf/solrconfig.xml.

* If you use solr field names that don't match the default field names used in Blacklight::AccessControls::Config for the "permissions" handler, you'll need to create a Rails initializer to set those values in Blacklight::AccessControls::Config.

h3. Run the generator

<pre>
rails generate blacklight:access_controls
</pre>


h2. Using Access Controls

Some notes about using blacklight-access_controls within your Blacklight app:

* You can grant access to a record to specific users or groups by adding them to the correct fields in the solr document.  For example, discover_access_group_ssim: "public" or read_access_person_ssim: "frodo@example.com".

* The gem expects user.groups to return a list of groups that the user belongs to.  By default, all users belong to a group called "public", and all logged-in users belong to a group called "registered".

* If you want a record to be readable by the public, you need to add "public" to the "read_access_group_ssim" field in the solr document, or if you want discover-only access, add "public" to "discover_access_group_ssim".  (Discover-only means that the user can see that the record exists in a catalog search, but won't be able to view the record itself.)
